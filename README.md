# MSCS-532-Assignment5

1. As a part of Week 4 and assignment 5, this repo contains python code in the file named "quicksort.py"
2. Source code should be run by python3. In case pandas is not installed in system, it must be installed first. Here is the terminal command to install pandas for python3: pip3 install pandas
3. matplotlib.pyplot should be installed if not iniitially installed.
4. Example: To run 'quicksort.py' in the terminal we should go to the directory where the file is saved and enter "python3 heapsort.py".
5. I have also added one of the output file named "output.txt" and image named "quicksort_performance_comparison.png" generated from running the program which has been used in report also just in case of need for validation.
6. I have also included the pdf version of report named "MSCS-532-Assignment5.pdf" so that mathematical equations could be stable.

Summary of Findings

-Randomizing the pivot in Quicksort is a neat trick to get the most out of this algorithm, keeping it fast and efficient in most real-world scenarios.
-In real-world scenarios, we'd pick randomized Quicksort for versatility, but the deterministic middle-pivot approach is no slouch for more predictable data.
